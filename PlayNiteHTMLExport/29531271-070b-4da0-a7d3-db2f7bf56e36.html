For the full details of the Green Army Men DLC and it’s availability, see above!</p><br><h1>Update 14 - Summer Holiday Update</h1><p>With our 14th update, we are bringing you both new content for Vietnam AND setting up for a completely new addition - Green Army Men will be going official!<br><br>Within Vietnam itself, you will get:<h2 class="bb_tag">2 new maps - the “Airbase Special”: </h2><ul class="bb_ul"><li>Khe Sanh - with this map, we play out the “what if” the PAVN forces had succeeded in penetrating the perimeter and the fighting had spilled over onto the airfield itself, as the USMC fight to hold the attackers at bay.<br></li><li>Da Nang - in another “what-if” scenario, the NLF guerillas breach the defenses of the huge Da Nang Air Base, with the USMC defenders trying to hold them back. </li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">Green Army Men: </h2>In addition, we will be taking the Green Army Men mod official, as a single DLC download, in the near future. Once it is released, all owners of Rising Storm 2: Vietnam will be able to play for free, using the base Rifleman class. And if, like us, you want to help support the Green Army Men developers (who are a mod team, building all of this in their spare time) you will be able to go and buy the Green Army Men Upgrade, which unlocks the other classes for you. All revenue from that Upgrade is shared with the Green Army Men team to support their efforts!

So keep your squad leaders alive at critical moments!<br><br>As for weapons, the Southern forces had a wide range of the best weaponry of Western nations, ranging from older, WWII-era leftovers, through to the latest technology of the time:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>M1 Garand, M2 Carbine, M3 “grease gun”, BAR and M1919 .30-cal LMG<br></li><li>M14 Battle Rifle, M40 and XM21 sniper rifles<br></li><li>M60 LMG and M16 automatic rifle<br></li><li>For heavier support - the M79 grenade launcher and M9A1-7 flamethrower<br></li><li>Explosives - M61 frag grenade, M8 smoke, C4 explosives and M18 Claymore</li></ul><h2 class="bb_tag">NORTHERN FORCES - NVA and VC</h2><br><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/418460/extras/Vietnamese.jpg?t=1600184580" /><br><strong>The Northern forces offer a broader mix</strong>, with the People’s Army of Vietnam (PAVN - or NVA) as the regular, disciplined and better-equipped main fighting force, in comparison to the National Liberation Front (NLF) guerrilla fighters, equipped with whatever weaponry was passed down the chain to them from Russia and China - known as the Viet Cong. For supporting weapons each has:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>PAVN/NVA - heavy artillery, surface-to-air missile defenses and rapid reinforcement from the Ho Chi Minh trail<br></li><li>NLF/VC - a mix of ordnances (mortars, rockets, white phosphorous) used in a heavy barrage</li></ul><br><img src="https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/steam/apps/418460/extras/Traps.jpg?t=1600184580" /><br><strong>To compete with the Southern forces’ mobility, the Northern forces have their own mobility - and stealth:</strong><br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>NVA and VC squad leaders can place spawn tunnels widely across the maps, allowing themselves and their squads to spawn much closer to the action - or even behind the lines<br></li><li>Given their “home field advantage”, any NVA or VC crouching or prone in cover can’t be spotted by Southern helicopters or aircraft<br></li><li>SA-2 Missiles - the quick way to counter Southern air assets is by calling on surface-to-air missiles, if the commander can time it right<br></li><li>“Ho Chi Minh Trail” ability - the NVA/VC commander can activate this ability to accelerate his team’s spawning rate, when times get desperate<br></li><li>“Ambush Spawn” ability - the NVA/VC commander can also cause anyone on his team who is waiting, to spawn on his location for potentially devastating ambushes.</li></ul><br>The weaponry for the Northern forces is wide-ranging - the PAVN well-equipped with modern weapons delivered from Russia and China, while the VC have to work with a wide variety of weapons:<br><ul class="bb_ul"><li>AK-47 and Type 56 Assault rifles<br></li><li>Russian SKS-45 and US M1 Carbines and Mosin Nagant 91/30 rifle<br></li><li>MN 91/30 and SVD sniper rifles<br></li><li>PPSh-41 and French MAT-49 SMGs<br></li><li>IZh-58 double-barrelled shotgun<br></li><li>DP-28 and RPD LMGs<br></li><li>RPG-7 rocket launcher<br></li><li>MD-82 toe-popper mines, Tripwires and Punji traps</li></ul>
