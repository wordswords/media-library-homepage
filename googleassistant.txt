## Nest Thermostat
* "Hey Google, what’s the temperature inside?"
* "Hey Google, make it warmer (or cooler)."
* "Hey Google, set the temperature to [#] degrees."
* 'Hey Google, raise (or lower) the temperature [#] degrees.'
* 'Hey Google, set the thermostat to heating.'
* 'Hey Google, turn thermostat to Heat • Cool mode.'

## Nest Camera
* 'Hey Google, play [camera's location name] camera on [display's name]. For example, 'Hey Google, play the porch camera on the living room Chromecast'.
* Tip: If you're speaking to a Nest Hub or Nest Hub Max, you can just say, 'Hey Google, show the [camera's location name]' and it will play the video on the display.
Hey Google, turn off [display's name]. This command will tell your display to stop showing video from your Nest camera, but it won’t turn your camera off.

## Netflix
### To use voice controls:
* Say the assistant's "wake word" to activate it. Some devices have a button to activate the assistant without the wake word.
* When the assistant is listening, say a supported voice command such as, "Hi Bixby, launch Netflix," or "Hey Siri, open Netflix."
### Actions:
Actions that can be done by voice command are:
* Open Netflix. Say "Launch Netflix" or "Open Netflix."
* Search or browse. We recommend adding "on Netflix" when searching, browsing, or playing a TV show or movie.
* To browse by category, director, or actor, follow these examples:
        "Show me comedies on Netflix."
        "Find movies by Steven Spielberg on Netflix."
        "Show me movies with Tom Cruise on Netflix."
* To search for a specific title, season, or episode:
        "Find Bird Box on Netflix."
        "Show me Stranger Things on Netflix."
* Play a TV show or movie. Tell your device the name of the TV show or movie you want to watch, for example, "Play The Irishman on Netflix."
* Control playback. To pause the TV show or movie you're watching, say "Pause." You can also use other controls like "play," "fast forward," and "rewind."

## Spotify
"Okay Google…"
* "Play Spotify."
* "Play my Discover Weekly."
* "Play hip-hop music."
* "Play Angel by Lionel Richie."
* "Pause."
* "Like this song."
* "Skip forward 20 seconds."
* "Play the next song."
* "What’s playing?"
* "What’s this album?"
