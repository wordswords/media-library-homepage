# media-library-homepage

![Screenshot](screenshot.png "Screenshot of latest version of page")

A simple personal homepage that I use to list and organise my media. It also acts as as 'personal home page' with lots of bookmarks I regularly use, and an 'intranet home page' with links only accessible when you're on my home local area network.

# Access

Go to https://home.davidcraddock.net.

The latest version will always be published there thanks to github actions.

# Reuse

You are free to reuse this project how you want. Let me know if I can be of any help.
