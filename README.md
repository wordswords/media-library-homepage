# media-library-homepage

A simple personal homepage that I use to list and organise my media.

## Requirements

Works under Debian Linux systems with Python 3 installed.

# Installation

Run the script `install-media-library-homepage-server.sh`.

# Accessing the homepage

The Python3 web server binds on all available interfaces on port 7777, so you should be able to access it on the installed computer via `http://localhost:7777` and over the network on port 7777 on your network IP address.

# Updating the homepage

After you have made edits and customised your homepage and want to serve the latest version, just run the script `update-media-library-homepage.sh`.

# Uninstalling

Run the script `uninstall-media-library-homepage-server.sh`.

# Reuse

You are free to reuse this project how you want. Let me know if I can be of any help.
